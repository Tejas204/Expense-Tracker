# Expense Tracker

This repository contains the code for an expense tracker web application. The major features of this application are:
1. Adding and expense with accompanying note. ex: Food -- $100
2. Adding your budget
3. Automatically tells you the budget left after you add an expense.
4. Notifies you once you spend all your budget.

## Details

In the project, you will run into:

### `React JS`

React is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on components.

### `useState Hook`

useState is a Hook that lets you add React state to function components. This react hook is used for a lot of different purposes in this project. Some of them are:
1. Passing values between components
2. Selecting payment option in the form of a slider
3. Setting the values of certain values based on user action.

### `useEffect Hook`

The Effect Hook lets you perform side effects in function components. In this project, the useEffect hook is extensively used to set values of variables, whenever they are updated.



### `Props`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### `Tailwind CSS`

This web app uses tailwind css for styling.

### `HTML`

Well, you cannot get anywhere without the basics.
